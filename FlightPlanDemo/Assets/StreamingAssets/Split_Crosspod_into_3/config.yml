  intro_text: "This experiment features the Crosspod program split into three parts: the forwarding logic is kept on the switch, and the booster logic is divided and offloaded to two supporting devices. This is a long experiment. Feel free to use 'Next Event Button (>>|)' to quickly move to the next point of interest."
